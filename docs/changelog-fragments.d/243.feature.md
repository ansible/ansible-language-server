Enhanced the logic of ansible-lint service to do the following things by
--{user}`priyamsahoo`:

- Fallback to `--syntax-check` in every failure scenarios (for eg. in case of
  wrong arguments passed, etc) and give visual feedback to the user in terms of
  notification about what went wrong.
- Handle different response types sent by ansible-lint (for e.g. ansible-lint
  sends failure reports as stdout and sometimes as errors) by making them
  uniform in terms of structure and redirection.
